              “I am a "Car Guy" who moved from retail into advertising, marketing and public relations.  I developed an internet based operating system for full service automotive advertising agencies - Ad Agency Online, L.L.C. - in December of 2001.  I currently consult for advertising agencies, auto dealers and vendor clients.  I also consult for a commercial real estate firm with a specialized division focused on the auto industry.

            %p							 
              As a "teacher" or "dealer coach" I pride myself in learning new things for my clients and then applying them to add to their list of "best practices."  To that end, I host a FREE auto industry resource portal - AdAgencyOnline.Net - to platform cutting edge technologies, internet applications and integrated sales processes.  I have earned a reputation as an expert on the automotive industry willing to share my success - and admit my failures - to insure that we all grow in the process.”
